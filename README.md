# AI Doctor with Vision and Voice 🏥

A conversational AI medical assistant that combines vision (image analysis), voice (speech-to-text), and natural language processing to provide medical insights. This project uses Gradio for the web interface and multiple AI APIs to deliver a seamless doctor-patient interaction simulation.

## 🌟 Features

- **Voice Input**: Record patient queries directly from the microphone
- **Medical Image Analysis**: Upload and analyze medical images using advanced vision models
- **AI-Powered Responses**: Get detailed medical insights using Groq's LLaMA model
- **Voice Output**: Listen to AI doctor responses through text-to-speech conversion
- **Web Interface**: User-friendly Gradio-based interface accessible via browser
- **Real-time Processing**: Instant transcription and analysis with streaming responses

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Python 3.13+** (project uses Python 3.13)
- **Microphone** (for voice recording)
- **API Keys**:
  - [Groq API Key](https://console.groq.com/) - For LLaMA model access and speech-to-text
  - [ElevenLabs API Key](https://www.elevenlabs.io/) - For high-quality voice synthesis
- **Internet Connection** - Required for API calls and model inference

## 🚀 Installation

### 1. Clone or Setup the Project

```bash
cd c:\Users\HP ENVY\Desktop\ai_voicebot
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or using Pipenv:
```bash
pipenv install
```

Required packages:
- `groq` - Groq API client
- `gradio` - Web UI framework
- `elevenlabs` - Text-to-speech synthesis
- `gtts` - Google Text-to-Speech (fallback)
- `pygame` - Audio playback
- `pydub` - Audio processing
- `speechrecognition` - Speech recognition
- `pyaudio` - Audio input/output
- `ffmpeg` - Audio/video processing

### 4. Set Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key_here
```

Or set them in your system environment variables:

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
$env:GROQ_API_KEY = "your_groq_api_key_here"
$env:ELEVENLABS_API_KEY = "your_elevenlabs_api_key_here"
```

## 📖 Usage

### Start the Application

```bash
python gradio_app.py
```

The application will start on: **http://127.0.0.1:7860**

### Using the Interface

1. **Record Audio**: Click on the microphone icon and speak your medical query
   - The app will automatically transcribe your speech to text
   
2. **Upload Image** (Optional): Upload a medical image for analysis
   - Supported formats: JPG, PNG, etc.
   - Images are analyzed along with your verbal query
   
3. **Submit**: Click the "Submit" button to process
   
4. **View Results**:
   - **Speech to Text**: Your recorded question transcribed
   - **Doctor's Response**: AI-generated medical insight
   - **Audio Response**: Listen to the doctor's response as voice

## 🔧 File Descriptions

### `gradio_app.py`
Main entry point for the application. Creates the Gradio interface with audio and image inputs, orchestrates the workflow, and displays results.

**Key Function:**
- `process_inputs(audio_filepath, image_filepath)` - Main processing pipeline

### `brain_of_doctor.py`
Handles medical image analysis using Groq's vision models.

**Key Functions:**
- `encode_image(image_path)` - Converts image to base64 for API transmission
- `analyze_image_with_query(query, model, encoded_image)` - Analyzes image with LLaMA model

**Model Used:** `meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct`

### `voice_of_the_patient.py`
Handles audio recording and speech-to-text transcription.

**Key Functions:**
- `record_audio(file_path, timeout, phrase_time_limit)` - Records audio from microphone
- `transcribe_with_groq(stt_model, audio_filepath, GROQ_API_KEY)` - Transcribes audio using Groq's Whisper model

**STT Model:** `whisper-large-v3`

### `voice_of_the_doctor.py`
Handles text-to-speech synthesis for AI doctor responses.

**Key Functions:**
- `text_to_speech_with_gtts(input_text, output_filepath)` - Uses Google TTS (with autoplay)
- `text_to_speech_with_elevenlabs(input_text, output_filepath)` - Uses ElevenLabs TTS (with autoplay)
